## Low Voltage Cascode Current Mirror vs Conventional Current Mirror

This project presents the **design**, **simulation**, and **performance comparison** of two commonly used current mirrors in analog circuit design:

- **Basic (Conventional) Current Mirror**
- **Low Voltage Cascode Current Mirror (LVCCM)**

  Tools Used: LTspice XVII

## What is a Current Mirror?
A current mirror is a circuit designed to **copy (or mirror)** a current from one active device to another, maintaining a **constant current** regardless of the loading. Current mirrors are fundamental in analog integrated circuits for **biasing**, **active loads**, and **signal processing**.

## ‚ö† Why Improve the Basic Mirror?
The basic current mirror, while simple, suffers from **low output resistance** and is sensitive to **channel length modulation**, which leads to **inaccurate current copying**, especially in low-voltage or high-gain environments.

To address these issues, **cascode and low-voltage cascode structures** are used to improve accuracy, **reduce output conductance**, and make the mirror suitable for **modern low-voltage CMOS technologies**.

##  Simple/Conventional Curent Mirror

The conventional current mirror consists of **two NMOS transistors** (typically M1 and M2).
- Simple and compact
, Low power consumption
, Easy to implement
- Low output resistance (~tens of kŒ©)
, Requires high voltage headroom: V<sub>GS</sub> + V<sub>DS(sat)</sub>
, Affected by channel length modulation (Œª ‚â† 0) ,
Limited precision for analog applications

## ‚öôÔ∏è Low Voltage Cascode Current Mirror (LVCCM)

The LV Cascode mirror enhances the basic structure by adding **two more NMOS transistors** and a **biasing voltage**, forming a cascode configuration.

## Benefits
- **High output resistance** (~hundreds of kŒ©)
- **Low voltage operation** (suited for modern CMOS tech)
- **more Accurate current replication**
- **Minimized channel length modulation**
- Ideal for precision analog circuits
 **but**
- Higher design complexity
- Slightly increased power consumption
